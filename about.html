   <h1 class="headline">Robert Nimmo:Web Design & Digital Marketing</h1>
   <p class="introduction">Hi, I'm Robert Nimmo, a freelance web designer based in Kilmarnock, Scotland. 
    I have always been fascinated by the power of digital media and the idea that with the right ideas 
    you can reach much further than your local communities and make meaningful connections with new clients 
    and customers. I started my web design journey by learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, 
    and since then I have been creating stunning websites for various clients and projects.</p>
