   <p class="introduction">Hi, I'm Robert Nimmo, a freelance web designer based in Kilmarnock, Scotland. 
    I started my web design journey by learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Getting comfortable with front-end 
    frameworks was my next aim so I quickly moved onto learning to design with bootstrap and tailwind css before
    I started building projects with React.js. Click on the link to see my favourite projects and find out 
    why I built them.
